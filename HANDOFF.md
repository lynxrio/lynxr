# Lynxr — session handoff

Read this, then `README.md` for architecture. **Last updated 2026-08-19.**

Lynxr (lynxr.io) is a format-intelligence platform for Lynx Media Group, a
short-form video agency. Static site on GitHub Pages + Supabase + a Python
pipeline. Three surfaces, one stylesheet (`app.css`):

| path | file | who |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | `index.html` + `home.js` | public — wait list capture only |
| `/creatorsonly/` | `creator.js` | creators — paste a link, get a script |
| `/agencyonly/` | `app.js` | staff — database, briefs, clients |
| `/privacy/` | static | the privacy policy, linked from all three |

## THE POINT (owner, 2026-08-19)

Creators get scripts from videos they already believe will perform. Those
pasted videos flow into `lynxr_sources`, which is how Lynx sees formats
**before** other UGC agencies saturate them. The creator app is a tool for
creators AND a sourcing sensor for the agency — that second half is the moat.

Consequence worth holding onto: `lynxr_videos` (9,016 scraped rows) is
**lagging** — it contains videos that already performed, which is why
competitors can find them too. `lynxr_sources` is **leading**. Its `tag_count`
is the saturation meter: one video pasted by three creators in a week is a
format spreading in real time.

**`lynxr_sources` has 15 rows and NOTHING reads it — 0 references in app.js.**
The sensor records; no dial exists. Highest-leverage unbuilt thing in the repo.

## Verified against the live DB this session — trust these over older notes

- **9,016 videos** in `lynxr_videos` (older docs say 9,905 / 2,640 — both wrong).
- **5 auth accounts, 1 staff row** (`lynxmedianetwork@gmail.com`).
  **`junsaemail@gmail.com` is NOT staff** — signing into the agency app with it
  shows an empty dashboard. That is the gate working, not a bug.
- **Creator isolation holds.** Proven with two throwaway accounts: a non-staff
  creator reads 0 rows from every table, cannot select/update/**delete**
  another creator's row, and cannot promote itself to staff (403).
  Re-run that probe after any RLS change; reading the .sql file is not evidence.
- **Scripts are written by GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/adaptations.yml`),
  **not** the owner's Mac. Public repo = free runners. Cron says every 15 min
  but real firings measured ~3h apart, so each run polls for ~5h45m and the
  concurrency group hands over run-to-run. Any push to main restarts the chain.
  (`io.lynxr.blueprints` launchd on the Mac is legacy/backup.)
- **Column fill rates** (sampled 1,000): `similar_format_count` and
  `avg_views_of_similar` 999/1000, `niche_category` 1000/1000,
  `target_audience` 999/1000, but **`creator_followers` only 467/1000** — any
  views-per-follower index is computable on half the corpus only.
- `signup_state()` returns `{open: true, invite_required: false}`. The seat
  table exists (`seats: 4`) but is not enforcing. **Owner's call: fine — the
  URL is unlisted and handed to trusted creators.**

## What shipped this session

**Wait list / public page**
- `source` is real now: `?ref=` → `?utm_source=` → referrer hostname →
  `landing`. Sanitised to `[a-z0-9._:-]`, 40 chars.
- **Consent is versioned.** `CONSENT` in home.js is `launch-and-updates-v2`.
  Rows carrying `launch-notify-v1` (or blank) agreed to a launch email ONLY —
  do not send them product updates, and do not retro-fit v2 onto them.
- **Unsubscribe.** `lynxr_waitlist.unsubscribed_at` (NULL = subscribed).
  **Every export must filter `&unsubscribed_at=is.null`** — the unfiltered URL
  still returns everyone. Tested end-to-end: marking one address dropped it
  from the export, then restored.
- Privacy policy at `/privacy/` — thorough, names every sub-processor, and
  discloses that staff can see pasted video links.

**Creator app**
- Signup requires an explicit ticked consent box; acceptance recorded as
  `ME.privacyAccepted = {version, at}` with `PRIVACY_VERSION = "2026-08-17"`.
- Privacy policy opens in a **modal that fetches `/privacy/`** rather than a
  second copy — edit the page, the modal follows. Falls back to a normal link.
- **Delete account** is self-serve and immediate (`supabase/delete_account.sql`,
  a SECURITY DEFINER function taking no arguments so it can only ever act on
  `auth.uid()`). Verified: HTTP 204, creator row 1 → 0, auth user gone.
- Manual script editing; Library renders scripts **inline** instead of linking
  out; one script per video per brand.

**Agency app**
- **Clients is the landing tab**, Database moved last (owner: the trend charts
  are a CHECK on lynxr's formats vs self-sourced, not the front page).
- **"Room to run"** — per-FORMAT saturation vs median reach, on the Database
  tab. Measured: POV is 1.2% of the corpus at 115,600 median views; Talking
  Head is 31.5% at 8,016.
- Blueprints: copy/edit/delete icon row matching the creator app, and manual
  editing stored as `b.editedBeats` — an OVERRIDE, never written over the
  transcript, so "Try again" and Revert both still work. Copy prefers it.

**Site-wide**
- **Lowercase house style, done entirely in CSS** (`body, button, select` +
  a content exclusion list). Deliberately NOT a source rewrite: `text-transform`
  changes what is drawn, so "copy script" still copies the creator's real
  casing. `.entity` opts the registered company name back out.
- System code font (`ui-monospace`), base 14px. Share Tech Mono is still in
  `fonts/`; put it back at the front of `--mono` to revert.

## Open — in the order I'd do them

1. **Client-matched video suggestions.** Owner's ask: suggested videos inside
   each client folder, scored PER VIDEO not per format, because a format's
   aggregate hides its own winners. **The scoring is validated**: `views /
   avg_views_of_similar` = did this beat its own format; `similar_format_count`
   = how crowded that pocket is. 8,925 of 9,016 rows scoreable, only **21% beat
   their format's average**, and the top picks are Talking Heads — the format
   that looks worst in aggregate. What's missing is the client join: video
   `niche_category` ↔ client `niche` / `ctx.audience`. I could not confirm the
   client record shape (the 2 rows didn't parse as expected) — check that first.
2. **Surface `lynxr_sources`** in the agency app, ranked by `tag_count` and
   recency. See THE POINT above.
3. Rest of the agency feedback: client fields (website, logo, description),
   a 4×4 video grid, briefs tagged by week, swap-a-video-in-a-brief (needs the
   grid), editable briefs (blueprints are done; briefs themselves are not).
4. **Send the launch email.** Draft at `~/Desktop/lynxr-launch-email.md`.
   Blocked on: linking the word "unsubscribe" to `{{{RESEND_UNSUBSCRIBE_URL}}}`
   (three braces, in the URL field) and verifying `send.lynxr.io` DNS.
   Resend's composer is a VISUAL editor — pasted markdown stays literal.
5. **Thumbnails on agency blueprints — blocked, not a CSS job.** Blueprints
   have no cover anywhere: `process_blueprints.py` never stores one and there
   are 0 blueprints in the DB. The pipeline already samples frames for the shot
   list; keeping one would fix it, plus an `img-src` entry in the agency CSP.

## Hard-won, do not rediscover

- **`creatorsonly/index.html` was destroyed and rebuilt from scratch on
  2026-08-18.** A backup copy collided on basename with `agencyonly/index.html`
  and overwrote it. The rebuild is verified — all **34 static element IDs**
  `creator.js` needs resolve — but if something obscure is missing from that
  page, this is why. Never back up two same-named files into one folder.
- **Cache stamps.** Every page carries `?v=YYYYMMDDx` on css/js. Bump on EVERY
  css/js change or browsers serve stale files. Currently `20260819a`.
  Note: the HTML documents themselves are not stamped, so a hard reload is
  needed to pick up markup changes.
- **Strict CSP, `style-src 'self'`.** No inline `style=""` — set via CSSOM.
  This once shipped invisible bar charts; verify painted pixels.
- **Never put `${...}` in a plain .html file.** It is JS template syntax and
  renders literally. Cost me three separate slips this session.
- **Flex basis, twice, opposite ways.** `flex: 1 1 0` squeezed "original
  scripts" onto two lines (zero basis ignores the text); `flex: 0 0 auto` then
  left dead space. `flex: 1 1 auto` + `nowrap` is the answer.
- **`.note` caps at `max-width: 70ch`.** Fine for prose, wrong for a footer
  rail — it silently stops a `space-between` row mid-page.
- **Re-render loses `<details>` open state.** Both apps have a `keepOpen`
  helper. In the Library a script card is nested inside its video entry, so
  reopening the card alone leaves it inside a collapsed parent — reopen both.
- **No `confirm()`** — browsers suppress repeats and it returns false instantly.
  Destructive actions use the two-click armed button (`armDelete`).
- **Tag one video per API request.** A batched design once returned a valid
  1-element array and silently tagged ~45% of rows.
- Repo is public. No secrets in files; the publishable key is public by design.
  **Never write a waitlist CSV inside the repo** — one `git add -A` publishes
  every address.
